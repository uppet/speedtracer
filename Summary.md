Speed Tracer is a tool for understanding web application performance. It works by hooking into instrumentation within the Google Chrome web browser to gather, analyze, and display profiling information.

You can run Speed Tracer as a Google Chrome extension running on Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh OS X, or Linux.

Using Speed Tracer you can help pinpoint performance problems caused by:
  * JavaScript execution
  * Layout
  * CSS style recalculation/matching
  * Network transfers
  * And much more!
