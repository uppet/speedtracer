Speed Tracer is a tool to help you identify and fix performance problems in your web applications. It visualizes metrics that are taken from low level instrumentation points inside of the browser and analyzes them as your application runs. Speed Tracer is available as a Chrome extension and works on all platforms where extensions are currently supported (Windows and Linux).

Using Speed Tracer you are able to get a better picture of where time is being spent in your application. This includes problems caused by:

  * Javascript parsing and execution
  * Layout
  * CSS style recalculation and selector matching
  * DOM Event handling
  * Network resource loading
  * Timer fires
  * XMLHttpRequest callbacks
  * Painting
  * and more ...
